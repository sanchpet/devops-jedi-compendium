title: The DevOps Jedi Compendium
---
Hello!

I'm glad you made it here. The page is currently under development, and I'm not sharing it publicly yet. That said, since you're here, feel free to take a look around!

The "Jedi DevOps Compendium" project serves several important purposes for me. It will contain a complete description of my journey as a DevOps engineer, along with all the key notes on my professional life, written in an accessible way. This can be called a personal knowledge base, but it's not a dump of documentation for various products or programs—rather, it's a way to remind myself of the most important things.

I also want to make this page a great resource for all DevOps engineers who want to learn from their peers. Since I share how and what I learned myself, along with important notes and links to sources and educational materials, anyone can use this page to broaden their horizons and acquire new competencies.

Right now, I'm just forming the content. There are also my "field" or draft notes here, which may lack substance. I'm continuing to figure out the [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) engine and gradually organizing the notes.
